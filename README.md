# simple-django-restful-api
This repository was created because I wanted to learn more about Django and how to create a rest api in it

## Steps
- python manage.py makemigrations -> to create file migrations
- python manage.py migrate -> to migrate database
- python manage.py createsuperuser -> to manage user db.sqlite3
- python manage.py runserver -> to run the server
